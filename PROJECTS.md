> **Goal:** Simulated and analyzed a 5-year ecosystem of Dhaka's ride-sharing market to optimize profitability and operations amidst traffic challenges.

* **🛠 Data Simulation:** Engineered a hyper-realistic dataset of **50,000+ trips** (2021–2025) using **Python**, incorporating complex logic for inflation, annual traffic decay, and seasonal weather patterns.
* **📊 Strategic Analysis:** Executed advanced **SQL** queries (Window Functions, CTEs) to identify that **surge pricing drives 83.7% of revenue**, validating traffic gridlock as the primary monetization lever.
* **📉 Visualization & Insight:** Designed a dark-themed **Power BI** executive dashboard revealing a **28% speed drop** during Monsoon season (June–Sept), leading to data-driven fleet allocation strategies.



### 2. 📈 [Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis – Fashion E-Commerce Retail  🔗](https://github.com/arifhossainrumi/Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Analysis)
#### 🗃️ End-to-End Analytics Project | Python · SQL · Power BI · Scikit-learn · Predictive Modeling


✅ Analyzed 3,900 customer transactions totaling $233K revenue, identifying key drivers of loyalty, subscription value, and promotional effectiveness using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) and PostgreSQL

✅ Built a Random Forest Classifier (AUC = 0.8283) to predict discount usage and K-Means clustering model to segment customers into 4 high-value groups (Loyal High-Spenders, Discount Seekers, At-Risk, Occasional Buyers)

✅ Designed an interactive single-page Power BI dashboard with synchronized slicers, a U.S. geographic map, KPI cards, and conditional formatting – enabling self-service insights for marketing and merchandising teams

✅ Delivered 6 strategic recommendations (inventory optimization, targeted discounting, geographic expansion, premium shipping bundling) projected to drive 15–22% revenue uplift ($35K–$51K annually)

🛠 Tech Stack: Python → SQL (PostgreSQL) → Power BI (DAX) → Machine Learning
